1) MongoDB:


Case Study: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

Scenario:
You are working on a project to develop a real-time analytics dashboard for a web application. The dashboard will provide insights into user behavior, traffic patterns, and system performance. The application generates a large volume of events that need to be processed and stored efficiently for real-time analysis.

Requirements:
1. The system should be able to handle a high volume of incoming events in real-time.
2. Each event contains information such as timestamp, user ID, event type, and additional data specific to the event.
3. The events need to be stored in a database for further analysis and reporting.
4. The database should support fast querying and aggregation of event data.
5. Implement a feature to visualize the analytics data using charts and graphs on the dashboard.
6. The database should provide horizontal scalability to handle increasing event volumes.
7. Ensure data durability and availability in case of system failures or crashes.

Tasks:
1. Design the MongoDB database schema to store the event data efficiently for real-time analytics.
2. Implement MongoDB queries for the following operations:
   a. Insert a new event into the database.
   b. Retrieve events within a specific time range, filtered by event type.
   c. Perform aggregation queries to calculate metrics like total events, events per hour, and user activity.
   d. Retrieve the top N users based on the number of events generated.
3. Discuss the benefits of using MongoDB's flexible schema for handling diverse event data.
4. Explain how MongoDB's replica sets and automatic failover can ensure high availability and data durability in the analytics system.

Case Study: Video Sharing Platform

Scenario:
You are working on a project to develop a video sharing platform similar to YouTube. The platform allows users to upload, view, and interact with videos. Your task is to design and implement the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Requirements:
1. The application should have a homepage that displays a list of featured videos.
2. Each video should have a title, thumbnail image, and duration.
3. Implement a search bar where users can search for videos based on keywords.
4. Clicking on a video should open a video player page where the selected video is played.
5. Users should be able to like, dislike, and comment on videos.
6. Implement a user login and registration functionality.
7. Create a user profile page that displays the user's uploaded videos and basic information.
8. Design a responsive layout that works well on different screen sizes and devices.
9. Implement basic styling to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.

Tasks:
1. Design the HTML structure and layout for the homepage, video player page, search bar, user login/registration forms, and user profile page.
2. Implement CSS styles to achieve the desired visual appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive layout.
3. Use JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as video playback, liking/disliking videos, and submitting comments.
4. Validate user input on the login and registration forms using JavaScript.

Implement a stack using linked lists.
A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO (last in, first out) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first item removed. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains data and a pointer to the next node.

To implement a stack using linked lists, you would need to create a linked list node class that stores the data and a pointer to the next node. You would then need to create a stack class that contains a pointer to the top node of the stack. The stack class would also need to have methods for adding and removing items from the stack.

Case Study 1: Phone Directory

Scenario:
You are tasked with designing a phone directory application that allows users to store and search for contact information. The application should support efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations on a large number of contacts. Additionally, it should provide search functionality based on contact names and phone numbers.

Which data structure(s) would you choose to implement the phone directory application? Justify your choice(s) and discuss the time complexity of the key operations.

Implement the data structure(s) you selected in question 1 and provide functions for inserting a contact, deleting a contact, and searching for a contact by name or phone number.

Analyze the time complexity of each operation in your implementation and suggest possible ways to optimize the data structure(s) or algorithms used to improve performance.
